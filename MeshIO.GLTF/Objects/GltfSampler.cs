		/// "LINEAR" The animated values are linearly interpolated between keyframes. When targeting a rotation, spherical linear interpolation (slerp) should be used to interpolate quaternions. The number output of elements must equal the number of input elements.

		/// "CUBICSPLINE" The animation's interpolation is computed using a cubic spline with specified tangents. The number of output elements must equal three times the number of input elements. For each input element, the output stores three elements, an in-tangent, a spline vertex, and an out-tangent. There must be at least two keyframes when using this interpolation.
